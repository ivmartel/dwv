A simple javascript/HTML5 (only) DICOM web viewer. 
Not yet fully DICOM compliant, for now only supports:
 * 512*512 2D images (or less)
 * Little Endian transfer syntax

All coding/implementation comments are welcome.

For now works only with local files. 

 * Firefox: straight out of the box,
 * Google Chrome: launch it with the command line option: `--allow-file-access-from-files`.

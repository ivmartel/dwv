# DWV

DWV (DICOM Web Viewer) is an open source zero footprint medical image viewer library. It uses _only_ javascript and HTML5 technologies, meaning that it can be run on any platform that provides a modern browser (laptop, tablet, phone and even modern TVs). It can load local or remote data in DICOM format (the standard for medical imaging data such as MR, CT, Echo, Mammo, NM...) and provides standard tools for its manipulation such as scroll, contrast, zoom, pan, MPR, annotation and imaging filters such as threshold and sharpening.

Try a [live demo](https://ivmartel.github.io/dwv/) and read a lot more information on the [docs](https://ivmartel.github.io/dwv/doc/stable/index.html) (such as [examples](https://ivmartel.github.io/dwv/doc/stable/tutorial-examples.html), [dicom conformance](https://ivmartel.github.io/dwv/doc/stable/tutorial-conformance.html), [pacs integrations](https://ivmartel.github.io/dwv/doc/stable/tutorial-integrations.html)).

## Available Scripts

- `Ã¬nstall`: install dependencies
- `lint`: run code linting
- `test`: opens a web page with test pages and karmas' results (with live reload)
- `test-ci`: one shot test run
- `build`: create release files
- `doc`: create documentation

I'm using `yarn` as the main package manager. Best to use it to install since
the lock file (that contains the exact dependency tree) is a yarn file.
All scripts also work with `npm`.

## Steps to run the viewer from scratch

```bash
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv.git

# move to its folder
cd dwv

# install dependencies
yarn install

# launch: will open a browser with example pages
yarn run start
```

This will open your default browser with the different example pages, check the 'viewer' link for a simple test viewer.

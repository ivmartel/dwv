Contributing to DWV
===================

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to DWV,
which is hosted at https://github.com/ivmartel/dwv on GitHub.

Steps
-----
If something is not right, the first step is to submit an issue with as much detail
about your problem and your configuration. This is to make sure this behaviour is not
intended (a 'feature').

The second step, for the braves, is to fork the repository and work on a fix. Don't hesitate
to ask for help, I am here for that! Once finished, you can propose a pull request. I will review
it, make comments and hopefully merge it.

License Terms
-------------
Code committed by you to this repository, whether written by you or a third party, must be
governed by the GNU General Public License version 3 ([GNU GPL v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)). By contributing Code,
you confirm that, to the best of your knowledge, the code does not violate the
rights of any person or entity.

You hereby grant me (Yves Martelli) and to recipients of software distributed by me
a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, relicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works. Except for this license
You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

_In plain English, I do this to simplify the licensing process and not have to ask every contributor
for his approval each time. Rest assured, the code and your contributions will always stay GPL._
